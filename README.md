World Population Trend Analysis

This project is based on Data that is available publically.

The link for the dataset - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2022&start=1960&type=points&view=chart

I downloaded the dataset removed the unwanted columns and altered it accordingly for convenience.

After transforming, used Pivot tables to create charts for visualization.
